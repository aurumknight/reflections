By comparing the game_old.js file and game_new.js file,
I was able to quickly realize that the issue that was
causing the game to not run correctly was a typo in the
changed code. Using the FC command allowed me to quickly
see what went wrong.

As we saw earlier, having old files to compare against 
can help you new bugs in old features after you change
the program. Also if you deleted an old feature and want
to add it back in, you can look at old versions where
the feature was present as a jumping off point. It is
also jsut helpful to know where you and the application
have been.

By manually choosing when to commit, you can seperate 
commits by logical changes where as if they were 
automatically saved, the changes would not always make
sense when you look back on them as it could have been
saved in the middle of implementing a new feature.

Git was created to work with coding projects that more
than likely would have multiple files, while Google 
Docs is a platform mostly used to create documents
which don't really interconnect with other files so
it wouldn't make sense to have a multi file version
history.

Git log can be used to list out the entire history of 
major or logical changes to your project and the git 
diff command can be used to determine was changed 
between two given versions of the project.

You would be more confident in making potentially 
project breaking changes because you can always go back
to a previous commit where the change wasn't implemented
and where everything worked.

My ultimate goal is to learn to use git at home and then
use it for my robotics team at school. I also figure it
will come in handy for any future coding projects as well
