A remote repo could be used to backup your local files to protect them and
so you could access them in places other tahn your local machine. The other
major reason is collaboration with others. Having the files be remote means
not everyone has to edit the project on one computer and that they could
access it at their leisure. 

Sometimes there might be a change that you don't want or wouldn't work with
your local files. Being able to pull cahnges by manually doing it only 
gives the programmer more control over their files and allows them to know
exactly what they are working with and only updating it when they feel 
ready.
