A remote repo could be used to backup your local files to protect them and
so you could access them in places other tahn your local machine. The other
major reason is collaboration with others. Having the files be remote means
not everyone has to edit the project on one computer and that they could
access it at their leisure. 

Sometimes there might be a change that you don't want or wouldn't work with
your local files. Being able to pull cahnges by manually doing it only 
gives the programmer more control over their files and allows them to know
exactly what they are working with and only updating it when they feel 
ready.

A clone is a copy of a repository either of one on your local system or
on GitHub. A fork is a copy of a repo on GitHub that still gives credit to
the original creator of the repo while allowing you to expand on it. A 
branch creates a commit history that seperates from the main history and
can be reconnected later. git clone would be used to get a repo you created
onto a new system, a fork on GitHub would used to copy someone else's repo
onto your GitHub account and from there onto your system and branches are 
used to experiment with new features or to allow every collaborator on a 
project have their own workspace.
