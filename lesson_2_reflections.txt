Initializing the repository turns a directory, empty or not,
into a git repository. You need to do this so you can use
git and version control with a set of files or single file.

The staging area is different from the working directory 
because the staging area doesn't neccesarily contain all of 
the files in the directory, it only contains the ones that
are about the be commited to the repository. The staging
area gives control over what changes you want to add to
your repository with any given commit so you can sort
everything into logical changes.
